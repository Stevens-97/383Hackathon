## Weather Forecast App

## Introduction

### This is our weather forecast app: a static page which calls for the data from the Open Weather API and formats it as necessary so that:

• the user is able to get an overview of 8 days weather forecast in their selected location.

• the user is also able to select a single day, so they can view a more detailed forecast of that specific day.

## Tech stack

### Front-end

• React
• Heroku
• Cypress
